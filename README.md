# Paws Rescue Center üêæ

This repository contains a project that I completed while learning [Flask: Develop Web Applications in Python](https://www.educative.io/courses/flask-develop-web-applications-in-python) on [Educative](https://www.educative.io/).

## Overview

Paws Rescue Center is an animal rescue center. The completed project contains different pages like Homepage, About Us, Sign Up, Log In and Pet Details.

For the Sign Up and Log In pages, Flask-WTForms has been used. It's connected to a SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
